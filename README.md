# PORTFOLIO
During my third year of engineering, I created a personal portfolio website using basic HTML. This project was a fundamental step to solidify my understanding of HTML and web development principles. The website, titled "Aditi's Personal Site," serves as a digital resume, showcasing my academic background, skills, and interests.
